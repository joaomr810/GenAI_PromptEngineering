    "- Loading a dataset using pandas.\n",
    "- Generating prompts (both zero-shot and few-shot) from stored Markdown files.\n",
    "- Sending prompts to an API endpoint for text generation.\n",
    "- Parsing and displaying the responses.\n",
    "- Looping over a subset of the data to compare true sentiment labels with predicted classifications."
