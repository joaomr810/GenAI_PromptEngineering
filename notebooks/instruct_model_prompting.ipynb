    "# Prompt-based Sentiment Classification\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to perform sentiment classification using a prompt-based approach with the finetuned instruct models. The workflow includes:\n",
    "- Loading a dataset using pandas.\n",
    "- Generating prompts (both zero-shot and few-shot) from stored Markdown files.\n",
    "- Sending prompts to an OLLAMA endpoint for text generation.\n",
    "- Parsing and displaying the responses.\n",
    "- Looping over a subset of the data to compare true sentiment labels with predicted classifications.\n"
